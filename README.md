The purpose of this project was to familiaize myself with working with APIs in Javascript. I use the Weatherbit API to fetch current temperature from a city specified by the user. In addition to learning about APIs, I learned how to create animations with CSS. More specifically, the app displays either a rain, sun, or cloud animation depending on the weather description fetched from the API.
